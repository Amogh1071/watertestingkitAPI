# Machine Learning and Software Development Internship at Chromosis Technology Pvt. Ltd.
## Overview
- This repository contains the work done during my internship as a Machine Learning and Software Development Intern at Chromosis Technology Pvt. Ltd. from December 2024 to January 2025. The project focused on developing a machine learning model to detect and analyze water testing kit strips.

## Objective

- Developed a machine learning model to detect the boxes of water testing kit strips and analyze the detected color.
- Accessed the model remotely through a web server API.

## Strategy

- Developed and fine-tuned the YOLOv11 model with a custom dataset to detect and categorize the boxes.
- Standardized color detection to minimize lighting effects.
- Developed an API using FastAPI to remotely process images on a server and enable future website and app integration.

### Result

- Achieved 98.80% accuracy.
- Successfully deployed to a production server with real-world validation.
